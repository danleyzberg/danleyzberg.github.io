I'll also be working on some software tools for computer science education that will, hopefully, one day be used by thousands of students all over the world.

                    <p>Before I came to Princeton, while I was still working on my Ph.D., I taught high school computer science classes part-time for six years at <a href="http://www.hamdenhall.org/" class="hamdenhall">Hamden Hall Country Day School</a>. I taught "AP Computer Science" (<a href="ap-syllabus.pdf">my old syllabus</a>) -- which covers about 40% of the material in <a href="http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~cos126/">COS 126</a>. I also taught an introductory course similar to <a href="http://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/fall13/cos109/" class="princeton">COS 109</a> called "Computer Science Principles," which was inspired by the <a href="http://www.csprinciples.org">new AP course</a> of the same name currently in development at the College Board. Over the summers, I taught an "Introduction to Robotics" class for grades 4-8.</p>

                    <p><b>Sam Spaulding</b> joined the Social Robotics Lab as a Yale freshman in 2010 and collaborated with me on a number of projects and papers. He presented one of our papers at the prestigious Human Robot Interaction conference in 2014. He also did very well on Jeopardy, Millionaire. Sam is currently in graduate school at the MIT Media Center.</p>

                    <p><b>Jenny Liu</b> was a junior at Amity High School when she first walked into the Yale Social Robotics Lab. She contributed to one of my earliest projects in grad school.

                    <p><b>Peter DeLong</b> was a stand-out student in my AP Computer Science class in 2011. He and I worked on a summer project that became a very useful tool for high school students and teachers to find good practice problems for Math League competitions called <a href="http://gnhml.org/browse" class="hamdenhall">GNHML</a>. It is still in wide use by students and teachers from all over the district today! Peter is matriculating at Princeton in 2014.</p>
                </div>
                <p>Let me note that, in no way am I trying to take credit for my mentees' success and accomplishments. All of these students worked their butts off and achieved great things on their own merits. I merely provided some support and guidance along the way. I list them here simply because I am proud of what they have done.</p>
                <h2>Education Technology</h2>
                <p>I am excited to get the chance to build some tools for teachers and students to improve computer science education. My first task is to improve our internal tools at Princeton, like those used in COS126, WebSheets and the Java Visualizer. Then, I'd like to allow the public to use them, and to build a teacher access point that allows high school teachers to effectively communicate with their students about code through the site.</p>

                    <a href="http://www.sigcse.org/events/symposia"><img src="images/sigcse-logo.gif"></a>
                    <p>You may know me from from a past <a href="http://sigcse2014.sigcse.org/">SIGCSE</a> conference. Right now I'm very interested in creating tools for computer science education. I have a few projects in the works at the moment on this topic. My goal is to get thousands of students to use them, all over the world. I think the tools we use to introduce students to programming affect their perception of computer science for years to come. Making good tools would increase participating in computer science by a wider range of students.</p>
                    <p>I'm also very interested in the public and layman perception of computer science as a discipline. We have come a long way since the 70's and 80's but there is still a lot to do.</p></p>

                    <a href="http://scazlab.yale.edu/"><img src="images/yale-robotics-logo.png" class="logo"></a>
                    <p>In a past life, I was a robotics researcher. I got my Ph.D. (pending) from <a href="http://cpsc.yale.edu">Yale University</a>, advised by <a href="http://cs.yale.edu/~scaz">Brian Scassellati</a>. I built robot tutors that adapted to individual students' needs.  models of individual learning differences in order to build robot tutors that personalize their instruction to suit the particular needs of individual students. This is a difficult problem to solve, even if a content expert defines the skills that the robot is assessing and teaching in advance, because the robot must decode the many-to-many relationship between the observations it makes of the student and the internal skills those observations represent. For instance, a calculus tutor who observes a student incorrectly solve an integral equation faces the non-trivial task of assessing which skills the student may need to review. It is a non-trivial task because more than one skill can be necessary for a single step in a calculus problem and each step a student takes may reflect proficiency in one of many skills.</p>

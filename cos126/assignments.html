<h1>Assignments</h1>

<P>
The purpose of this assignment is to introduce you to programming
in Java and familiarize you with
the mechanics of preparing and submitting assignment 
solutions. You will learn to use the DrJava editor for
writing, compiling, and executing programs, and the Dropbox system for submitting your solutions.


<p><b>Installing the course software.</b>&nbsp;
The <b>introcs</b> package includes everything that you need for this course:
the Java compiler and runtime, the DrJava development environment,
the course libraries, and tools <code>checkstyle-introcs</code> and 
<code>findbugs-introcs</code> that you can use to review your work.

<p>If you have problems installing the software, check with the preceptors or lab TAs; you can report 
issues on <i>Piazza</i> where we can determine what advice to give everyone.

<ul>
<p><li>
<em>Installing on your own computer.</em>
Follow the step-by-step instructions
for your operating system:
<A href = "/introcs/11hello/windows.html">Windows</a>,
<A href = "/introcs/11hello/mac.html">OS X</a>, or
<A href = "/introcs/11hello/linux.html">Linux</a>.
If you are familiar with your operating system, you should be able to finish this
part on your own.
If you are hesitant, bring your laptop to Friend 017.
The lab is staffed most evenings with knowledgeable TAs who can assist you.
Don't be afraid to ask for help.

<p><li><em>Working in a public cluster.</em>
If you prefer to work in one of the OIT public clusters
<!-- <a href = "http://www.princeton.edu/clusters/index.shtml">OIT public clusters</a> -->
follow the instructions for
<A href = "/introcs/11hello/windows.html">Windows</a> or
<A href = "/introcs/11hello/mac.html">Mac OS X</a> 
<em>but skip the steps that involve installing software</em> because
Java and DrJava are already installed.
Go straight to the "Create the program" instructions. 
See instructions <a href="docs/cluster.html">here</a> on how to set up your user account folder/H: drive and how to 
enable your account, if necessary.
If you are hesitant, work in Friend 017.
The lab is staffed most evenings with knowledgeable TAs who can assist you.
Don't be afraid to ask for help.
</ul>


<p><b>Programming.</b>&nbsp;
Your job is to write additional short programs on your own. We'll assume that you
have already
created, compiled, and executed <tt>HelloWorld.java</tt> by following the
instructions in the previous part of the assignment.

<ol>

<p><li><em>Command-line arguments.</em>
Read Section 1.1 of the textbook.
Modify <a href = "/introcs/11hello/UseArgument.java.html">UseArgument.java</a>
to make a program <tt>HiFour.java</tt> that 
takes four names as command-line arguments
and prints out a proper sentence with the names in the 
<b>reverse</b> of the order given, so that, for example,

<blockquote><pre>
% <b>java HiFour Alice Bob Carol Dave</b>
</pre></blockquote>

outputs
<blockquote><pre>
Hi Dave, Carol, Bob, and Alice. 
</pre></blockquote>

<p><li class='fall-only'><em>Integer variables.</em>
Read Section 1.2 (through page 22) of the textbook.
Write a program <tt>SumThree.java</tt> 
that reads in three integer command-line arguments.
The program then outputs all three numbers and their sum in the
form of an equation. 

<blockquote><pre>
% <b>java SumThree 2 5 8</b>
2 + 5 + 8 = 15
</pre></blockquote>

<p><li class='spring-only'><em>Boolean and integer variables.</em>
Restriction: <i>You must not use <tt>if</tt> for this problem &mdash; 
you can use it starting next week.</i>
Write a program <tt>Ordered.java</tt> 
that reads in three <tt>int</tt> command-line arguments, 
<em>x</em>, <em>y</em>, and <em>z</em>.
Define a <tt>boolean</tt> variable <tt>isOrdered</tt> whose
value is <tt>true</tt> if the three values are either in
strictly ascending order  (<em>x &lt; y &lt; z</em>) or
in strictly descending order (<em>x &gt; y &gt; z</em>),
and <tt>false</tt> otherwise. Print out the variable
<tt>isOrdered</tt> using <tt>System.out.println(isOrdered)</tt>.
<blockquote><pre>
% <b>java Ordered 10 17 49</b>
true

% <b>java Ordered 49 17 10</b>
true

% <b>java Ordered 10 49 17</b>
false
</pre></blockquote>


<p><li class='spring-only'><em>Floating-point numbers and the Math library.</em>
The <em>great circle distance</em> is the shortest distance between two points on
the surface of a sphere if you are constrained to travel along the surface.
Write a program <tt>GreatCircle.java</tt> that takes four <tt>double</tt>
command-line arguments <tt>x1</tt>, <tt>y1</tt>, <tt>x2</tt>, 
and <tt>y2</tt>
(the latitude and longitude, in degrees, of two points on the surface of the
earth) and prints out the great-circle distance between them (in nautical
miles) using the following formula derived from the spherical law of cosines:

<blockquote>
<img src = "hello-files/great-circle.png" alt = "Great circle distance formula">
</blockquote>

This formula uses degrees, whereas Java's trigonometric functions use
radians. Use <tt>Math.toRadians()</tt> and <tt>Math.toDegrees()</tt> to convert
between the two. 

<blockquote><pre>
% <b>java GreatCircle 40.35 74.65 48.87 -2.33</b>      // Princeton to Paris 
3185.1779271158425 nautical miles  
</pre></blockquote>


<p><li class='spring-only'> <em>Type conversion.</em> &nbsp;
Several different formats are used to represent color. For 
example, the primary format for LCD displays, digital cameras, and web pages, 
known as the <em>RGB format</em>, specifies the level of red (R), green (G), 
and blue (B) 
on an integer scale from 0 to 255. The primary format for publishing books and 
magazines, known as the <em>CMYK format</em>, specifies the level of cyan (C), magenta 
(M), yellow (Y), and black (K) on a real scale from 0.0 to 1.0. 

<p>
Write a program
<tt>RGBtoCMYK.java</tt> that converts RGB to CMYK. Input three 
<b>integers</b>,
<tt>red</tt>, <tt>green</tt>, and <tt>blue</tt> (not all zero), from
the command line, and print the equivalent CMYK values using these formulas: 


<blockquote>
<img src = "hello-files/rgb-cmyk.png" alt = "RGB to CMYK formula">
</blockquote>

<p><em>Hint.</em> <tt>Math.max(x, y)</tt> returns the maximum of <tt>x</tt> and <tt>y</tt>.

<blockquote><pre>
% <b>java RGBtoCMYK 75 0 130</b>       // indigo
cyan    = 0.423076923076923
magenta = 1.0
yellow  = 0.0
black   = 0.4901960784313726
</pre></blockquote>


</ol>

<p><b>Program style and format.</b>&nbsp;
Now that your program is working, go back and look at the program itself.
Did you include a header that will tell the reader who wrote the program,
and what it does? 

(Instructions
for compiling or running the program
are optional. The latter is especially useful when there are command-line arguments.)

For full marks, your program should not only work correctly, but should 
conform to the recommended style and format so that it is easy to follow.
Read Booksite Appendix B: Writing Clear Code.  Follow the
guidelines in the <b>Reviewing your Programs</b> section of the <a href="../checklist/hello.html">checklist</a>.


<p><b>Writeup.</b>&nbsp;
With each assignment you must submit a text file named <tt>readme.txt</tt>
that is a narrative description of your work. Some weeks there are also
analysis questions to complete.
We provide a 
<a href = "ftp://ftp.cs.princeton.edu/pub/cs126/hello/readme.txt">readme.txt</a>
that you should use as a template. 
Download this file and
answer all questions in the space provided.

<p><b>Collaboration Policy Quiz.</b>&nbsp;
As indicated in the readme template, part of this week's assignment is to complete the
Collaboration Policy Quiz.
Read
the COS 126 <A HREF="../assignments.php#collabpolicy">Collaboration 
Policy</A>, then access the quiz on the Course Materials area of Blackboard. 
You can re-take it as many times as you like, and you must re-do the quiz until you get all questions correct.

<p><b>Questionnaire.</b>&nbsp;
Part of this assignment is to fill out the following
<a href = "../cgi-bin/survey.cgi">brief questionnaire</a>.



<p><b>Browsing the course website.</b>&nbsp;
The next part of the assignment is to browse the COS 126 website.
The address is:
<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE><a href = 
"http://www.princeton.edu/~cos126">http://www.princeton.edu/~cos126</a></PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>
It is essential that you understand what's where and how to get to it.
Please follow the Treasure Hunt worksheet
on the <a href="../precepts.php">Precepts page</a>. 
(You may complete this part with a classmate.)


<p><b>Submitting the assignment.</b>&nbsp;
The final part of the assignment is to
submit <tt>HelloWorld.java</tt>, <tt>HiFour.java</tt>, 
<span class='fall-only'><tt>SumThree.java</tt>,</span>
<span class='spring-only'>
<tt>Ordered.java</tt>,
<tt>GreatCircle.java</tt>, <tt>RGBtoCMYK.java</tt>,
</span>
and <tt>readme.txt</tt> via the Web submission system called 
<em>Dropbox</em>. To do this, click the
<em>Assignments</em> link from the course website;
click the <em>Submit</em> link for that assignment; and (if you aren't 
already logged in) login using your OIT NetID and email password.
Upload the required files, and click the <em>Check All Submitted Files</em> 
button. 
Your programs should compile without errors or warnings; if not, fix the
problem and resubmit the appropriate files.
(The dropbox runs a few basic checks; passing it doesn't guarantee your program is 100% correct.)
Remember that <em>every</em> file you submit needs to have your name, 
netID, and precept number.


<p><b>Getting help.</b>
If anything is unclear, don't hesitate to drop by office hours,
post a question on Piazza or email us.
We also recommend reading the
<a href = "../checklist/hello.html">checklist</a>, which provides
some clarifications and answers to frequently asked questions.

<div class='spring-only'>

<p><b>Challenge for the bored</b> (not extra credit). Try to solve 
<tt>Ordered</tt> without using any of the four ordered-comparison 
operators (<tt>&lt; &lt;= &gt; &gt;=</tt>). 
Try to solve <tt>RGBtoCMYK</tt> without using <tt>Math.max()</tt>.
You don't need to use <tt>if</tt> for either one. 
<em>Even if you solve these, please submit your
original simpler solutions, which are less likely to have bugs
and are more transparent to read.</em>

<h3>Submitting Your Work</h3>
<p>You must submit your solutions electronically via the Dropbox submission system.
You will need to type your Princeton netID and password for authentication.
Be sure to type your name, login and precept number at the top of every file you submit.
Also be sure to click the <em>Check All Submitted Files</em> button to make sure that
you have submitted all of the required files and that they compile cleanly.
  If you do not follow these directions, you will lose a substantial number
of points. You may unsubmit, resubmit, and recheck your solutions as often as you like
(but see the special directions below for late submissions).</p>


<h3>Deadlines</h3>

Each assignment is due at midnight on a Monday. An assignment submitted at 12:01 AM on Tuesday or later
will be considered late, with a penalty of 4 points per day (or partial day) late.
<ul>
<li> Avoid waiting until midnight since we stop answering Piazza questions by 9 PM
 and the lab TAs never stay past 11 PM.
</li>
<li> Give yourself enough time to upload the files and run the online checks.
In fact, it is to your advantage to obtain this feedback as soon as your code is even partially functional.
</li>
<li>
Your first 16 lateness points are automatically waived.
No additional lateness points will be waived without the
recommendation of a Dean or a letter from McCosh Health Center.
The absolute deadline for all written work is Dean's Date.
</li>
<li>
  <i>Once  the submission deadline passes, you have to be more careful with
                   your dropbox submissions</i>:
                   anything in the submit directory when we happen to do grading, will be graded as-is.
                   Therefore, if you wish to submit an assignment late,
<i>unsubmit all files</i> on Monday at midnight and don't leave anything permanently in your dropbox
until you are ready to submit
<em>all</em> of your files for that assignment.

</li>
<li>
Extra credit may not be submitted late.
</li>
</ul>


<h3>Computing Facilities and Lab TAs</h3>
<p>Most evenings, there is a room on campus staffed with

  undergraduate lab TAs,

who can answer general computer-related questions
and assist in debugging.
Lab TAs will be in Lewis 134 for those with laptops most evenings. The New Media Center right next door will have a few computers that have DrJava installed.
  <a href="people.php#labtas">Click here for more information, their location and their schedule.</a>

<!-----The Friend 016 and Friend 017 computing laboratories are open 24 hours a day.
They contain desktop computers, which can run either OS X or Windows;
alternatively, you may bring your own laptop.--->


If you have specialized questions
regarding the course materials or programming assignments, see your
preceptor or instructor.

 <li><a href="#plagiarism">Plagiarism</a></li>
 </ul>

 <p>In this course you may only receive help from people in the ways described below.
 You <b>must</b> acknowledge all help in the readme.txt file for that week's assignment.
 </p>
<p>You are not allowed to post questions about the course
or about assignments on any website
other than the course Piazza page.</p>
<p> If you have any question whatsoever about what is allowed, ask us!</p>


<h3><a name="your-work">Your Work</a></h3>
<p>When we talk about work, this includes code, comments, readme files, or anything else you create for this course.</p>

<p>You must individually compose all of your own work during the term.</p>

<p>Your work must never be shown or communicated to anyone who is taking COS 126 now or
who might take COS 126 in the future. <ul><li>Abetting plagiarism is a serious offense. Offenders will be reported to
the Committee on Discipline for investigation.</li></ul></p>

<p>You must never place your work in any public
location (including websites, leaving printouts in a classroom, etc). Password-protect your laptop if left unattended.</p>

<p>You must never give a copy of your work to anyone, except for course staff.</p>

<p>The rules above apply both to finished and unfinished work. They continue to apply even after this semester is over.</p>

<p>In some assignments, you are given some code to begin with.
Like other course materials, you are allowed to read and discuss the
original <!--given file-->code with other students, to figure out what it does and how it works.
But once you make a change to the <!--file-->code, it becomes your work and the rules above apply to it.
</p>

<h3><a name="citing">Citing and Allowable References</a></h3>
<p>Copying or adapting work that is not yours is <b>only permitted if it comes from the course materials</b>. If you do so, you must cite what you used.
<!--(Our course materials are: the textbook, booksite, assignments, lecture notes, and precept materials.)--></p>

<ul><li> A sample citation:</li>
<pre>
/* The formula below comes from "Luminance.java" on the booksite,
   http://introcs.cs.princeton.edu/java/31datatype/Luminance.java.html */
      return .299*r + .587*g + .114*b;
</pre>
<li>
  It's optional to cite anything that the assignment
  or checklist tells you to copy.
</li></ul>

<p>

<i>Reading</i> someone else's solutions (or partial solutions) for assignments (or anything similar to any COS 126 assignment) is not allowed.


<h3><a name="getting-help">Getting Help</a></h3>

<p>Ask for help &mdash; that is why the course staff members are here! Utilize office hours<!-- (you can go to anyone's office hours)-->, the lab TA hours, and Piazza.
E-mail your preceptor or make an appointment with them.
Avoid procrastinating, since getting help requires extra time.</p>

<p>If you don't know where to start on an assignment, try beginning with the "Possible Progress Steps" on the checklist, and review the related exercises on the Precepts page.</p>


<h3><a name="peers">Peer/Piazza Discussion</a></h3>

<p>You must individually compose your solutions for the course, but some common concerns
may be discussed with other current students, or publicly on Piazza.
Because of the rules above, these discussions must be kept at a general level,
without sharing code or other work about assignments.
For example, you may ask about:</p>
<ul>
  <li> How to interpret an error message. E.g., "What does <tt>StackOverflowError</tt> mean?"</li>
  <li> Using the DrJava GUI or command-line interface. E.g., "How do you copy text from the Terminal/Command Prompt?"</li>
  <li> The definition of a piece of Java syntax. E.g., "What are the parts of a <tt>for</tt> loop?" </li>
  <li> Clarifying wording in lecture slides, readings, or the requirements specified by an assignment.</li>
  <li> Book/booksite/precept exercises or old exam questions. </li>
</ul>
<p>Don't let someone be <i>too</i> helpful: it is not allowed for someone to lead you step-by-step
through any part of an assignment.</p>

<h3><a name="graduates">Help From COS 126 Graduates</a></h3>
<p>Anyone who successfully completed COS 126 in a previous term
is allowed to assist you in the following ways, similar to what a lab TA would do:</p>
<ul>
  <li>They may look at your code.</li>
  <li>They must not do any writing or typing (in short, "hands in pockets").</li>
  <li>They may help debug, but they must not give directions on what steps are necessary to complete the assignment.</li>
  <li>They should give thought-provoking suggestions rather than dictating what to change.</li>
  <li>While helping you, they must not look at any other solutions, including their own old ones.</li>
  <ul><li>They can't give high-quality help if they need to rely on a reference. Please seek course staff, office hours, lab TAs or Piazza instead.</li>
  </ul>
  <li>They must not help with extra credit (see below) at all.</li>
</ul>
Anybody else (e.g. friends, family, tutors) may help you under these same conditions (provided they are not taking COS 126 now and never will in the future).


<h3><a name="piazza">Piazza Etiquette</a></h3>
<p>Piazza works best for individual questions with well-defined answers.</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Clearer questions get better answers. Re-read your question before you send it. See: <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2012/03/rubber-duck-problem-solving.html">Rubber Duck Problem Solving (Jeff Atwood)</a>
  </li>
  <li>
    For multiple questions or interactive discussions, it's better to visit office hours or make an appointment with a preceptor.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Use public posts when your question can be asked in a general way,
without sharing code or other work about assignments. Other students may answer it, or they
may benefit from seeing the discussion.</p>

<p>If you have a question that involves your code or
other specific details, then use office hours, the lab, or this two-step approach:</p>
<ol><li>post a public Piazza question that describes your problem in general terms;</li>
<li>if the answer does not help, post your specific question privately.
If your code is involved, upload it to the Dropbox, and mention this.</li>
</ol>

<p>Never post assignment code to Piazza, even privately; the Dropbox is easier for course staff to use.</p>


<h3><a name="pairing">Pair Programming</a></h3>
<p>On certain assignments the collaboration policy is relaxed to allow working with a partner.</p>
<ul>
  <li>You are permitted to partner for any 4 of the 5 assignments designated as "pair programming".</li>
  <li>Work with a partner whose skill level is close to your own.</li>
  <li>You <b>must</b> use <i>pair programming</i>: one partner types (the driver) and the
  other reviews the work, identifies bugs, and asks questions (the navigator). Swap roles each 30 to 40 minutes.
  Take breaks from coding to brainstorm and discuss high-level ideas.</li>
  <li>See: <a href="assignments/pairs-kindergarten.pdf">
  All I Really Need to Know About Pair Programming I Learned in Kindergarten (Laurie Williams and Robert Kessler)</a></li>
  <li><b>All</b> work for that assignment must be done with both of you
  <b>together</b>, sharing the same computer screen. This includes debugging,
  testing, commenting, writing the readme, and submitting the files online.</li>
  <li>Come to office hours or the lab with your partner. Otherwise
  you cannot change your code while you visit.</li>
  <li>You should each keep a copy of your final submission.</li>
  <li>To transfer files between partners, you <b>must</b> use e-mail attachments or flash drives. Using file-sharing or pastebin-like webservices is specifically <i>not allowed</i> for security reasons.</li>
  <li>Do not log in to the CS dropbox from your partner's machine, and do
  not give your partner your CS dropbox password.</li>
</ul>

<p>If two students begin working on an assignment as partners and cannot complete it together, at least one student must contact the lead preceptor to request a partnership dissolution.</p>


<h3><a name="extra-credit">Extra Credit</a></h3>
<p>Some assignments have optional <i>Extra Credit</i> parts. These are for people who found the assignment straightforward
and want an extra challenge.
</p>
<p>
Don't rely on them to "bring up" your grade,
as we only give them a small discretionary value at end of term
for people close to a grade boundary.</p>
<p>Extra credit has stricter collaboration rules.</p>
<ul>
  <li>You must not discuss it, even conceptually, with anyone other than course staff.</li>
  <li>Course staff will only help clarify the wording of directions that are unclear. (Similar to an exam.)
  They will not tell you what steps are necessary or how to accomplish them.
  </li>
  <li>On extra credit <b>in assignments where you partner</b>, you may choose to either do the extra credit
  separately or together.
  Decide this <i>before</i> you begin the extra credit. Indicate who did it in your readme.</li>
</ul>


<h3><a name="retaking">Taking COS 126 Again</a></h3>
<p>If you took COS 126 (or part of it) before,</p>
<ul>
  <li> You may look at your old work but you must not look at the
  feedback we gave you on your old work.</li>
  <li>You may not look at your old work on assignments where: you
    previously partnered; or you are partnering this time; or you
    were previously found responsible for plagiarism by the
    Committee on Discipline.</li>
</ul>
<p>It has been our experience that students who
re-do all of the assignments from scratch are much more likely to
succeed in the course, so this is what we strongly recommend.

<h3><a name="plagiarism">Plagiarism</a></h3>
<p>If <b>anything</b> about these policies is unclear during the course, <b>please</b> consult us and ask for clarification.
Princeton's <a href="https://www.princeton.edu/pub/rrr/">Rights, Rules, Responsibilities</a> handbook asserts:</p>

<blockquote>The only adequate defense for a student accused of an academic violation is that the work in question does not, in fact, constitute a violation. Neither the defense that the student was ignorant of the regulations concerning academic violations nor the defense that the student was under pressure at the time the violation was committed is considered an adequate defense.</blockquote>

<p>We use software to compare student submissions. Pairs that are identified as similar are inspected manually by course staff.</p>

<p>Violators of the course policy will be referred to the Committee on Discipline for review. If found responsible, you will receive an F as a course grade plus whatever disciplinary action the Committee imposes. The typical penalty they impose for plagiarism is suspension from the University for one year.</p>

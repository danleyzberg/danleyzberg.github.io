				drive.</li>

place them in your user account folder
(or whatever subdirectory you're using to write and compile your code).
Installing all of <tt>stdlib.jar</tt> is not necessary for exams
and may be time-consuming. <b>Remember to compile them.</b></li>

<li>To access the tools:
<ul>
	<li>In <b>OS/X</b>, use the Spotlight to find Terminal and DrJava.
	<ul>
		<li>Terminal will usually wake up in the <tt>MACOSXFILES</tt> directory.
				Type <tt>cd ..</tt> to back up one directory to your user account folder.
		<li>Create a sub-folder for the exam or assignment in this user account folder,
				then <tt>cd</tt> into it.  Store all pertinent files in this sub-folder.
		<li>In DrJava use Save As to save the files into this sub-folder.
				(<tt>/Users/username/subfoldername/filename</tt> should appear at the top
				of the DrJava window, where <tt>username</tt> is <b>your</b> username,
				<tt>subfoldername</tt> is the name of the sub-folder you just created, and
				<tt>filename</tt> is the name of your file.)
<!--
		Fall14 October this line had to be added 2 days before the exam.
		Upon revisiting the instructions Fall14 November, this instruction
		is no longer needed.  All three compiler options seem to work. - Donna
		<li>In DrJava, use the Compiler drop-down menu (at the lower right) and
				select the Eclipse Compiler option.
-->
		<li>In Terminal, cd from your user directory to the correct directory.
				You can compile and run from the command line.
		<li>NOTE: If you compile in DrJava, you can run in either DrJava or Terminal.
				If you compile in Terminal, you will only be able to run in Terminal.
				You will not be able to run in DrJava until you
				re-compile in DrJava.
		<li>To submit, go to the submission page, click <tt>Choose File</tt>
				or <tt>Browse</tt> and
				use the dropdown menu at the top of the mini-window that appears to
				select your user directory, the sub-folder, and finally your file.
		</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>In <b>Windows</b>, <ul>
		<li>Click on the Start Menu (bottom left) and type <tt>cmd</tt>
				to get the Command Prompt.
				In the Command Prompt, type "<tt>H:</tt>" (and return/enter) to
				navigate from the C drive to the H drive.</li>
		<li>Create a sub-folder on your H drive for the exam or assignment,
				then cd into it.  Store all pertinent files in this sub-folder.
		<li> There may be a DrJava icon on the Desktop. DO NOT USE IT!  It is broken.
		<li>As of Fall 2014, DrJava has a shortcut in the Applications folder.
				The Applications folder is on the Desktop (on the left, towards the top).
				Open the Applications folder.  Click on DrJava.  Close the Applications folder.

<h2>Resources</h2>

<p><strong>Website.</strong>This website contains a wealth of resources for students to practice and study computer science, including archives of lecture slides, online programming activities with solutions, a Java visualizer, and the past five years of exams with solutions. This site can be found at the following address: <a class="url" href="http://www.princeton.edu/~cos126">http://www.princeton.edu/~cos126</a></p>

<p><strong>Software.</strong>This course has an associated software package called <b>introcs</b> that enables students to write and test code. Students may install it on their own computer by following the instructions for their operating system, whether they are running <a href="http://introcs.cs.princeton.edu/java/windows/">Windows</a>, <a href="http://introcs.cs.princeton.edu/java/mac/">Mac</a>, or <a href="http://introcs.cs.princeton.edu/java/linux/">Linux</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Cluster computers.</strong>For students who may not have a computer or for students whose computers fail during the semester, we provide cluster machines in Friend Center 017 with the course software pre-installed. <a href="cluster-instructions.html">Click here for information on using the labs.</a></p>

<!--Posts marked private are viewable only by instructors.
<!--<b>Never post
assignment code to Piazza</b>. Doing so publicly violates the collaboration policy,
but even privately it is difficult for us to read large chunks of code in Piazza.
If your question requires us to look
at your java file(s), consider office hours, the lab, or this two-step
approach:
(1) ask a general question describing your problem;
(2) if you're still stuck afterwards,
upload your files to the assignment dropbox and ask your specific
question in a private post (mention that you uploaded to dropbox).-->

<h2>GRADING</h2>

<img src="images/grade-weighting-pie-chart.png" style="float:right; width:400px; margin-left: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px;">

<p><strong>Weighting.</strong> Semester grades in COS 126 are composed of two two-part exams, worth a combined 50%, nine weekly programming assignments worth 40%, and one final programming project worth the remaining 10.</p>

<p><strong>Curve.</strong> We typically do not curve grades in this course. You should expect that the cutoff for an "A" will be approximately 93% of the available points, an "A-" will require approximately 90% and so on.</p>

<p><strong>Midterm exams.</strong> There are two two-part exams during the semester. One will be given in middle of the semester, and one in the last week of classes. Both exams consist of a written portion, worth 70% of the exam grade, and a programming portion, worth the remaining 30. There will be no final.</p>

<p><strong>Programming assignments.</strong> There are nine weekly programming assignments all equally weighted.</p>

<p><strong>Final project.</strong> The final project is a large programming assignment (approximately the size of two of the weekly assignments) due at the end of Reading Period.</p>

<p><strong>Late submissions.</strong> All assignments are due at midnight. Submissions made at 12:01am <i>will be</i> marked late. If any part of an assignment is submitted late, the entire assignment will be marked late. Student have four free late days to use as they wish throughout the semester on the nine programming assignments. There are no partial late days. Students who submit late work, after they have used up all four free late days will lose 20% of the possible points on the late assignment <i>per day or partial day late</i> thereafter. Outside of this late day policy, the only late work that will be excused are for students in medical or personal distress as indicated by a letter from their Dean, Director of Studies, or from McCosh Health Center. We will not accept any work for this semester after Dean's Date.</p>

<a href="images/extra-credit-skeptical-baby.jpg"><img src="images/extra-credit-skeptical-baby.jpg" style="float:right; width:200px; margin:10px;"></a>
<p><strong>Extra credit.</strong> Some of the assignments in this course feature optional extra credit sections intended for students who have completed every other part of the assignment first. In COS 126, extra credit points are only given a small discretionary value at the end of the term. Rather than adding the extra credit points to the total number of earned points in the semester, the course staff considers extra credit for students who end the semester close to a grade boundary, potentially pushing an "A-" to an "A" for example. Note that extra credit sections have stricter collaboration and late policies than the rest of the assignment. Extra credit may not be submitted late under any circumstances. Extra credit may not be discussed, even conceptually, with anyone except the course staff. Even then, course staff are only permitted to clarify the wording of the extra credit, like we would on an exam question. We do not want staff to give students hints or tips on extra credit nor help debug a student's extra credit code. Students working on a partnered assignment may choose to do the extra credit individually or together. You should decide this <i>before</i> you begin the extra credit. Indicate who did it in your <tt>readme.txt</tt> file.</li></p>

<p><strong>Regrading.</strong> To err is human. We may make a mistake while grading your work. To request a regrade, please write a short note describing the potential mistake atop the graded work and return it to your preceptor within two weeks of that work being handed back.</p>

<p><strong>Auditing.</strong> Auditors must identify themselves to the lead preceptors via email as soon as possible. Auditors will receive only automated feedback on work (i.e. immediate feedback in the submission system, as well as an e-mailed copy of the testing performed on their submissions). To earn audit credit, you must: complete all of the programming assignments and the final project, using at most four late days. Auditors do not take the exams in this course.</p>

<h2>Collaboration</h2>

<a href="http://dailyprincetonian.com/news/2014/03/convictions-of-plagiarism-in-computer-science-courses-on-the-rise"><img src="images/convictions-daily-prince.jpg" class="paragraph-visual"></a>
<p><strong>Context.</strong> COS 126 is a difficult course that requires a <i>significant time commitment</i> for most students. If you fall behind, <i>please</i> ask for help! The course staff will be happy to go through any part of the material with you and help you work on your assignments or study for exams. It takes us between ten and twenty hours to bring each plagiarism case. We would much rather spend that time helping you learn the material than advocating for your punishment, after you've plagiarized.</p>

<p>We want our students to know that we actively police the submissions made to us for each assignment and each exam. We have archives of every publicly-available online source of our assignments and ten years of Princeton student submissions. We compare these results both by automated systems that check for similarities in code structure and by hand. We take no pride in bringing plagiarism cases to the Committee on Discipline, but we will continue to do so when students plagiarize because we feel it's necessary to keep the playing field level for the vast majority of students who put in a lot of honest work into the course. Please read <a href="http://dailyprincetonian.com/news/2014/03/convictions-of-plagiarism-in-computer-science-courses-on-the-rise/">this article by The Daily Prince</a> for a recent account of plagiarism cases in COS 126.</p>

<!-- Late 2014 / Early 2015 draft:
<p><strong>External sources.</strong> Students are <i>not</i> permitted to use any reference material containing code, including websites and online forums, not affiliated with this course. Students <i>must</i> acknowledge any and all help received on assignments in the <tt>readme.txt</tt> file submitted with each assignment. Students may <i>not</i> post questions about the course or about assignments on any website not affiliated with this course. Instead of looking at external materials, students are encouraged to post questions to Piazza.</p>
<p><strong>Abetting plagiarism.</strong> Students must keep the work they produce for this course, including code, comments, readme files, and any other work product, <i>absolutely</i> private and confidential. Sharing work with any student, whether that student is in the course or not in the course, is considered <i>abetting plagiarism</i> -- a serious offense prosecuted by the Committe on Discipline.	This policy applies regardless of the method of sharing: whether a student emails his/her work to another student, hands a physical copy of his/her work to another student, posts his/her work to a website or repository where another student can access it, or shares his/her password with another student. This policy applies to finished work as well as to unfinished work, graded and ungraded. This policy applies during the semester as well as after the semester. The course staff maintains an archive of all of work submitted to us in the last ten years. We can and do prosecute students who plagiarize from previous submissions. Students are encouraged to ask the course staff, ideally over Piazza, if they have any reason to be concerned that what they're doing constitutes plagiarism.</p>
-->

  <h3>Ground Rules</h3>
  <p>In this course you may only receive help from people in the ways described below. You <b>must</b> acknowledge all help in the readme.txt file for that week's assignment</p>
  
  <p>You are not allowed to post questions about the course or about assignments on any website other than the course Piazza page.</p>
  
  <p>If you have any question whatsoever about what is allowed, please ask us!</p>

 
  <h3>Your Work</h3>
  <p>When we talk about work, this includes code, comments, readme files, or anything else you create for this course.</p>

<ul>
  <li>You must individually compose all of your own work during the term.</li>
  <li>Your work must never be shown or communicated to anyone who is taking COS 126 now or
who might take COS 126 in the future.</li>
  <li>Abetting plagiarism is a serious offense. Offenders will be reported to
the Committee on Discipline for investigation.</li>
  <li>You must never place your work in any public location (including websites, leaving printouts in a classroom, etc). Password-protect your laptop if left unattended.</li>
  <li>You must never give a copy of your work to anyone, except for course staff.</li>
</ul>

<p>The rules above apply both to finished and unfinished work. They continue to apply even after this semester is over.</p>

<p>In some assignments, you are given some code to begin with.  
Like other course materials, you are allowed to read and discuss the 
original <!--given file-->code with other students, to figure out what it does and how it works.
But once you make a change to the <!--file-->code, it becomes your work and the rules above apply to it.
</p>

<h3>Citing and Allowable References</h3>
<p>Copying or adapting work that is not yours is <b>only permitted if it comes from the course materials</b>. If you do so, you must cite what you used.
<!--(Our course materials are: the textbook, booksite, assignments, lecture notes, and precept materials.)--></p>

<ul><li> A sample citation:</li>
<pre>
/* The formula below comes from "Luminance.java" on the booksite,
   http://introcs.cs.princeton.edu/java/31datatype/Luminance.java.html */
      return .299*r + .587*g + .114*b;
</pre>
<li>
  It's optional to cite anything that the assignment 
  or checklist tells you to copy.
</li></ul>

<p>

<i>Reading</i> someone else's solutions (or partial solutions) for assignments (or anything similar to any COS 126 assignment) is not allowed.




<h3>Peer Discussion</h3>

<p>You must individually compose your solutions for the course, but some common concerns
may be discussed with other current students, or publicly on Piazza.
Because of the rules above, these discussions must be kept at a general level, 
without sharing code or other work about assignments.
For example, you may ask about:</p>
<ul>
  <li> How to interpret an error message. E.g., "What does <tt>StackOverflowError</tt> mean?"</li>
  <li> Using the DrJava GUI or command-line interface. E.g., "How do you copy text from the Terminal/Command Prompt?"</li>
  <li> The definition of a piece of Java syntax. E.g., "What are the parts of a <tt>for</tt> loop?" </li>
  <li> Clarifying wording in lecture slides, readings, or the requirements specified by an assignment.</li>
  <li> Book/booksite/precept exercises or old exam questions. </li>
</ul>
<p>Don't let someone be <i>too</i> helpful: it is not allowed for someone to lead you step-by-step
through any part of an assignment.</p>

<h3>Help From COS 126 Graduates</h3>
<p>Anyone who successfully completed COS 126 in a previous term
is allowed to assist you in the following ways, similar to what a lab TA would do:</p>
<ul>
  <li>They may look at your code.</li>
  <li>They must not do any writing or typing (in short, "hands in pockets").</li>
  <li>They may help debug, but they must not give directions on what steps are necessary to complete the assignment.</li>
  <li>They should give thought-provoking suggestions rather than dictating what to change.</li>
  <li>While helping you, they must not look at any other solutions, including their own old ones.</li>
  <ul><li>They can't give high-quality help if they need to rely on a reference. Please seek course staff, office hours, lab TAs or Piazza instead.</li>
  </ul>
  <li>They cannot help with extra credit at all.</li>
</ul>
Anybody else (e.g. friends, family, tutors) may help you under these same conditions (provided they are not taking COS 126 now and never will in the future).



<h3>Pair Programming</h3>
<p>On certain assignments the collaboration policy is relaxed to allow working with a partner.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Work with a partner whose skill level is close to your own.</li>
  <li>
<img src="images/pair-programming.jpg" style="float:right; padding: 0px 15px 15px 15px;">You <b>must</b> use <i>pair programming</i>: one partner types (the driver) and the
  other reviews the work, identifies bugs, and asks questions (the navigator). Swap roles each 30 to 40 minutes.
  Take breaks from coding to brainstorm and discuss high-level ideas.</li>
  <li>See: <a href="assignments/pairs-kindergarten.pdf">
  All I Really Need to Know About Pair Programming I Learned in Kindergarten (Laurie Williams and Robert Kessler)</a></li>
  <li><b>All</b> work for that assignment must be done with both of you <b>together</b>, sharing the same computer screen. This includes debugging,
  testing, commenting, writing the readme, and submitting the files online.</li>
  <li>Come to office hours or the lab with your partner. Otherwise you cannot change your code while you visit.</li>
  <li>You should each keep a copy of your final submission.</li>
  <li>To transfer files between partners, you <b>must</b> use e-mail attachments or flash drives. Using file-sharing or pastebin-like webservices is specifically <i>not allowed</i> for security reasons.</li>
  <li>Do not log in to the CS dropbox from your partner's machine, and <b>do not give your partner your CS Dropbox password</b>.</li>
</ul>

<p>If two students begin working on an assignment as partners and cannot complete it together, at least one student must contact the lead preceptor to request a partnership dissolution.</p>


<h3>Taking COS 126 again.</h3>
<p> If you took COS 126 (or part of it) before, you may look at your old work but you may <b>not</b> look at the feedback we gave you on your old work. What's more, you may not look at your old work on assignments where: you previously partnered; or you are partnering this time; or you were previously found responsible for plagiarism by the Committee on Discipline. In our experience, students who re-do all of the assignments from scratch are much more likely to succeed in the course, so this is what we strongly recommend.</p>

<h3>Plagiarism</h3>
<p>If <b>anything</b> about these policies is unclear during the course, <b>please</b> consult us and ask for clarification.
Princeton's <a href="https://www.princeton.edu/pub/rrr/">Rights, Rules, Responsibilities</a> handbook asserts:</p>

<blockquote>The only adequate defense for a student accused of an academic violation is that the work in question does not, in fact, constitute a violation. Neither the defense that the student was ignorant of the regulations concerning academic violations nor the defense that the student was under pressure at the time the violation was committed is considered an adequate defense.</blockquote>

<p>We use software to compare student submissions. Pairs that are identified as similar are inspected manually by course staff.</p>

<p>Violators of the course policy will be referred to the Committee on Discipline for review. If found responsible, you will receive an F as a course grade plus whatever disciplinary action the Committee imposes. The typical penalty they impose for plagiarism is suspension from the University for one year.</p>

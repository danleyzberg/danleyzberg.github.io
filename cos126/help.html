<!-- PAGE TITLE -->
<h1>HELP</h1>
The COS 126 staff is very happy to help students review curriculum and work on assignments. We have set up several methods for you to reach us, we recommend taking advantage of as many of these as you wish.

<h2>Piazza</h2>
<p>Perhaps our most important tool for answering questions is <a href="http://piazza.com/princeton/fall2014/cos126">Piazza</a>, an online forum that is accessible only to you, your fellow classmates, and the course staff. On Piazza, you can post a question <i>annonymously</i> and get an answer as soon as anyone on the course staff has a free moment. Our average response time is about ten minutes. However, please be aware that questions posted after midnight may not be answered until the following day.</p>

<h2>Office Hours</h2>
<p>The staff offer weekly office hours, which you may attend whether or not you are in that instructor's precept. Princeton COS also hires <a href="syllabus.html#undergrad-lab-tas">undergraduate lab teaching assistants</a> to help students debug their code and review concepts. The schedule for office hours and lab TA's can be found below. Note, please <i>click on an event</i> to see its location and details.</p>

<p class="alert-box"><strong>Warning.</strong> This schedule may change as circumstances dictate. Please check back here before going to office hours.</p>

<h3>One-On-One Review Sessions</h3>
<p>The nature of the curriculum is this course is cumulative, such that if a student falls behind, they will need to first catch up with what they missed in order to understand the concepts currently being covered. If you find yourself falling behind, <i>be proactive</i>. Contact your preceptor as soon as possible to schedule a one-on-one meeting to review the material. It is the job of the preceptor to be available for his or her students that need review.</p>

<h3>Newbie Workshops</h3>
<p>Due to the cumulative nature of the curriculum, students who have been exposed to programming in the past will have an advantage early in the course over students who have never programmed a computer. In order to allow our newbie students a more equal footing, we offer weekly newbie workshops on Sunday afternoons that act as review of the week's material as well as additional practice that newbies need. For students who have not programmed before COS 126, we strongly suggest making plans to attend these newbie sessions every week.</p>

<h3>Peer Tutors</h3>
<p>Students who find themselves struggling in the course, despite taking advantage of the resources described above, should contact <a href="syllabus.html#lead-preceptors">the lead preceptors</a> as soon as possible. Individual peer tutors may be arranged for students who are making every effort to succeed but not seeing good results.</p>

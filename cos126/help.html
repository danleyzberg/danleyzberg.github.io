<h1>Help!</h1>
<a href="https://piazza.com/class/i4pvyqe8kzv1i5"><img src="images/piazza-logo.png" class="paragraph-illustration"></a>
<p>Stuck? Confused? Falling behind? The staff is here to help! The best and fastest way to reach us is through <a href="https://piazza.com/class/i4pvyqe8kzv1i5">Piazza</a>, an online forum where you can post questions <em>annonymously</em> and get an answer from the course staff <em>rather quickly</em>. Our average response time is under fifteen minutes, though questions posted after midnight are not answered as quickly. We encourage students to make Piazza <em>an integral part of their COS 126 experience</em>. Keeping up with the questions that other students ask is a great way to spot-check your progress against your peers.</p>

<h2>Office Hours &amp; Lab TA's</h2>
<p>You can also get help in person via our frequent office hours. You're welcome to attend <i>any staffmembers' office hours</i>, not just your preceptor's office hours. In addition to staff office hours, you can get help from the <a href="http://labta.cs.princeton.edu/">undergraduate teaching assistants</a>, who are upperclassmen COS majors and happy to help you debug your code.</p>
  
<p class="alert-box"><strong>Note.</strong> We update this calendar with the latest information when we need to make scheduling changes. Though last-last minute changes are relatively rare, please check this calendar again before going to office hours.</p>

<h2>I Missed My Precept!</h2>
<p>Ah! Worry not my dear soul. If you missed a precept or you will be missing a precept, you should attend another COS 126 precept to get the same instructional content and avoid falling behind in the course! To pick your replacement precept, keep in mind that all Tuesday and Wednesday precepts feature the same instructional content, as do all Thursday and Friday precepts. Once you've picked a replacement precept from <a href="syllabus.html#staff-table">the staff list</a>, email both preceptors in advance to ensure that everyone knows what's going on and both precepts run smoothly.</p>

<h2>Need more help?</h2>
<p>COS 126 is hard. We make it that way on purpose, but we also offer plenty of resources if you should find yourself struggling. "Far better is it to dare mighty things, to win glorious triumphs, even though checkered by failure... than to rank with those poor spirits who neither enjoy nor suffer much, because they live in a gray twilight that knows not victory nor defeat." (Teddy Roosevelt, 1899)</p>

<p>If you find yourself falling behind in COS, <b>be proactive</b>. Contact your preceptor as soon as possible to schedule a meeting to review  material and make a gameplan. If you don't feel comfortable talking to your preceptor, email the lead preceptors to arrange to get some help. We will be happy to meet with you regularly, weekly if necessary, and get you a peer tutor from your college to help you succeed in this course.</p>

    
<!--<h3>Newbie Workshops</h3>
<p>Due to the cumulative nature of the curriculum, students who have been exposed to programming in the past will have an advantage early in the course over students who have never programmed a computer. In order to allow our newbie students a more equal footing, we offer weekly newbie workshops on Sunday afternoons that act as review of the week's material as well as additional practice that newbies need. For students who have not programmed before COS 126, we strongly suggest making plans to attend these newbie sessions every week.</p>

<h3>Peer Tutors</h3>
<p>Students who find themselves struggling in the course, despite taking advantage of the resources described above, should contact <a href="syllabus.html#lead-preceptors">the lead preceptors</a> as soon as possible. Individual peer tutors may be arranged for students who are making every effort to succeed but not seeing good results.</p>

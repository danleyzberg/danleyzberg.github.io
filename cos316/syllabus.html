		<h1>Syllabus</h1>

		<p><strong>Description.</strong> This course is an introduction to computer science in the context of scientific, engineering, and commercial applications. The goal of the course is to teach basic principles and practical issues, while at the same time preparing students to use computers effectively for applications in computer science, physics, biology, chemistry, engineering, and other disciplines. Topics include: programming in Java; hardware and software systems; algorithms and data structures; fundamental principles of computation; and scientific computing, including simulation, optimization, and data analysis.</p>

		<p><strong>Prerequisites.</strong> None.</p>

		<p><strong>Video lectures.</strong> Available <a href="lectures.html">here</a>.</p>

		<p><strong>Class meetings.</strong> Class meetings are held twice per week, on Tuesdays &amp; Thursdays.</p>

		<p><strong>Precepts.</strong> Precepts meet twice per week, on either Tuesdays &amp; Thursdays or Wednesdays &amp; Fridays.</p>

		<p><strong>Graders.</strong>The following undergraduates are graders this semester: Akiva Goldberger, Al Liang, Alik Zalmover, Amina Elgamal, Anlin Zhang, Begum Ortaoglu, Ben Ryu, Benjamin Coles, Charles Smith, Cheyenne Zhang, Christine Cho, Christy Lee, Claire Chiu, Clare Cook, Eileen Wang, Elise Colter, Elizabeth John, Gabriel Grajeda, Geoffrey Zheng, Grace Stempel, Grace Wei, Hannah Huh, Jacqueline He, Jacqueline Xu, Janet Wang, Jasmin Gao, Jeanna Joseph, Jeremy Chizewer, Julia Ruskin, Kenneth Peng, Kevin Feng, Khatanbuuvei Bold, Kwan Sirisakunngam, Lillian Xu, Matthew Penza, Michael Fletcher, Mwad Saleh, Noah Daniel, Oluwamayowa Oke, Rachana Balasubramanian, Rahul Saha , Sadie Van Vranken, Saisha Agrawal, Sarah Gao, Selena Chiu, Tiffany Sun, Tim Feng, Victoria Talvola, Young Ha Yoo, John Willett.</p>

		<h2>Precepts</h2>
		<a name="precepts-table"></a>

		<p>Precepts are an integral part of this course. We offer two formats: 50-minute so-called <b>"regular precepts"</b> and 80-minute "<b>extended-time precepts</b>." Both formats are designed for students with no computing background, but we have found that some students prefer to have more time to ask questions and learn at a more relaxed pace.</p>

		<p><b>If you miss your precept,</b> you can attend any other precept section. All Tuesday and Wednesday precepts cover the same content; all Thursday and Friday precepts cover the same content. We ask that you email the other preceptor in advance to let him/her know that you're coming.</p>

		<h2>GRADING</h2> <img src="images/grade-weighting-pie-chart.png" style="float:right; width:400px; margin-left: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px;">

		<p><a name="course-grades"/></a><strong>Course grades.</strong> Course grades are based on nine weekly programming assignments (40%), two written exams (35%), two programming exams (15%), and a final programming project (10%). There is no curve: you must earn, at a minimum, 93.0% of the available points for an A, 90.0% for an A–, 87.0% for a B+, 83.0% for a B, 80.0% for a B-, 77.0% for a C+, 73.0% for a C, 70.0% for a C-, or 60.0% for a D. You will fail the course if you earn below 60.0% of the available points.</p>

		<p><strong>Midterm exams.</strong> There are two two-part exams during the semester. One pair will be given in the middle of the semester; the other pair in the last week or so of classes. The exams have a written portion and a programming portion. There is no final exam. No makeup exams will be considered without a Dean's recommendation and our approval in advance.</p>

		<p><strong>Programming assignments.</strong> There are nine weekly programming assignments, all equally weighted.</p>

		<p><strong>Final project.</strong> The final project is a large programming project, approximately the length of two weekly assignments. It is due toward the end of Reading Period.</p> <a name="late-days"></a>

		<p><strong>Late work.</strong> Assignments are due on Monday nights at 11:59pm. Submissions made at 12:00am will be marked late. If any part of an assignment is submitted late, the entire assignment will be marked late. To submit an assignment late, mark the checkbox on our online submission system (i.e., TigerFile) that indicates that your work is incomplete. If the deadline has passed and the checkbox is not marked, we will grade submitted work as-is. We will not accept any work after Dean's Date without a Dean's recommendation.</p>

		<p><strong>Penalties for late work.</strong> Late assignments are assessed a penalty equal to 20% of the possible points on the assignment <em>per day or partial day</em> late. The penalties for your first four late days are automatically waived. Additional late penalties will be waived only in the case of unforeseeable circumstances like medical emergencies, as documented by your Dean or Director of Studies.</p>
		<!--<p><strong>Extra credit.</strong> Some of the assignments in this course feature optional extra credit sections intended for students who have completed every other part of the assignment first. In COS 126, extra credit points are only given a small discretionary value at the end of the term. Rather than adding the extra credit points to the total number of earned points in the semester, the course staff considers extra credit for students who end the semester close to a grade boundary, potentially pushing an "A-" to an "A" for example. Note that extra credit sections have stricter collaboration and late policies than the rest of the assignment: Extra credit may not be submitted late under any circumstances. Extra credit may not be discussed, even conceptually, with anyone except your partner and the course staff. Course staff are only permitted to clarify the wording of the extra credit, as we would on an exam question. Staff should not give hints or tips on extra credit nor help debug a student's extra credit code. Students working on a partnered assignment may choose to do the extra credit individually or together. You should decide this <i>before</i> you begin the extra credit.</p>-->

		<p><strong>Regrades.</strong> If you feel we have made a mistake while grading your work, write a short note describing the potential mistake and attach it to the graded work. Return it to your preceptor within two weeks of the work being handed back.</p>
		<!-- <p><strong>Auditors.</strong> Auditors must identify themselves to the lead preceptors via email as soon as possible. Auditors will receive only automated feedback on work. To earn audit credit, you must successfully complete all of the programming assignments and the final project, using at most four late days. Auditors do not take exams in this course.</p> --><a name="collab"></a> <a name="collaboration"></a> <a name="collab-policy"></a> <a name="collaboration-policy"></a>

		<p><strong>Your solutions.</strong> You must individually compose all of your solutions. The term <em>solutions</em> refers to any of the products created when completing a programming assignment, such as source code (including comments) and the <tt>readme.txt</tt> file. It includes both finished and unfinished products, regardless of correctness or completeness.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>You must never expose solutions to anyone who is taking COS 126 now or who might take COS 126 in the future.</li>
			<li>If you leave your computer unattended, be sure to protect it with a password.</li>

		<p>All the rules above continue to apply after assignments are graded and after the end of the semester.</p>

		<p><strong>Collaboration with course staff.</strong> You are welcome to discuss your solutions with course staff members (instructor and preceptors) in office hours or via private Piazza posts. Do not post or email us your code; instead, submit it via the course submission system.</p>

		<p><strong>Collaboration with classmates.</strong> We encourage you to discuss common concerns with classmates either private via personal interactions or publicly in the Piazza course forum. These discussions must be kept at a general level, without exposing your solutions. </p>

		<p><strong>Collaboration with students who have already taken COS 126.</strong> Anyone who successfully completed COS 126 in a previous term, including lab TAs and peer tutors, may assist you in the following ways:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>They may look at your code.</li>
			<li>They must not write, type, or dictate code.</li>
			<li>They may help debug, but they must not give step-by-step directions on how to complete the assignment.</li>
			<li>They should give thought-provoking suggestions rather than dictating what to change.</li>
			<li>While helping you, they must not look at any other solutions, including their own.</li>
		</ul>
		<!-- Other individuals may help you under these same conditions, provided they are not taking COS 126 now and never will in the future. -->
		</li><a name="pair-programming"></a>

		<p><strong>Collaboration with a partner.</strong> On certain assignments the collaboration policy is relaxed to allow working with a partner, subject to the following rules:</p>
		<ul>
			<!-- <img src="images/pair-programming.jpg" class="paragraph-illustration">-->
			<li>Choose a partner whose skill level is close to your own.</li>
			<li>Complete all work with your partner, sharing the same screen. This includes debugging, testing, commenting, writing the <tt>readme.txt</tt>, and submitting the files.</li>
			<li>Go to office hours or the lab with your partner; one partner may not edit the code without the other partner present.</li>
			<li>Use the following pair programming protocol: one partner, the driver, types the code and the other partner, the navigator, reviews the code, identifies bugs, and asks questions. Swap roles every 30 minutes.</li>
			<li>Use email attachments or flash drives to transfer files with your partner. Do not post your code where it is visible to anyone but you and your partner.</li>
			<li>To dissolve a partnership, you must contact your preceptor.</li>
			<!-- <li>See: <a href="assignments/pairs-kindergarten.pdf"> All I Really Need to Know About Pair Programming I Learned in Kindergarten (Laurie Williams and Robert Kessler)</a></li> -->
			<!-- <li>Keep a copy of your final submission, even if your partner submitted it.</li> -->
			<!-- <li>Do not log in to Dropbox from your partner's machine; do not give your partner your Dropbox password.</li> -->
		</ul>
		<!-- <p><strong>Collaboration with yourself.</strong> If you took COS 126 (or part of it) during a previous term, then you may refer to your solution for an assignment from the previous term provided that (1) you composed the solution individually, (2) you don't partner on that assignment this term, and (3) you acknowledge it in your <tt>readme.txt</tt>. However, in our experience, redoing the assignment from scratch will significantly increase your chance of success in the course.</p> -->
		<!-- <p><strong>Collaboration with yourself.</strong> If you took COS 126 (or part of it) before, you may look at your old work but you may <em>not</em> look at the feedback we  gave you on your old work. Moreover, you may not look at your old work on assignments where: you previously partnered; or you are partnering this time; or you were previously found responsible for plagiarism by the Committee on Discipline. In our experience, students who re-do all of the assignments from scratch are much more likely to succeed in the course, so this is what we strongly recommend.</p>-->

		<p><strong>Collaboration acknowledgment.</strong> You must acknowledge all collaboration in the <tt>readme.txt</tt> file for that week's assignment.</p>
		<!-- <p><strong>Collaboration acknowledgment.</strong> You must acknowledge any collaboration (whether authorized or unauthorized) in the <tt>readme.txt</tt> file for that week's assignment. Using and acknowledging unauthorized collaboration will typically result in a grade of 0 for the assignment (but no further penalty).</p> -->

		<h2>Plagiarism</h2> Plagiarism and abetting plagiarism are serious academic infractions. Programming is a creative work and the academic regulations that apply to plagiarizing prose also apply to plagiarizing code. Princeton's <a href="https://www.princeton.edu/pub/rrr/">Rights, Rules, Responsibilities</a> defines plagiarism as "the use of any outside source without proper acknowledgment." It ranges from "verbatim copying" (e.g., cutting-and-pasting code) to "thorough paraphrasing" (e.g., changing variable names or rearranging code).
		<!--
    <blockquote><em>The only adequate defense for a student accused of an academic violation is that the work in question does not, in fact, constitute a violation. Neither the defense that the student was ignorant of the regulations concerning academic violations nor the defense that the student was under pressure at the time the violation was committed is considered an adequate defense.</em></blockquote>
  -->

		<p><strong>Outside sources and citations.</strong> Copying or adapting code that is not yours is permitted <em>only</em> if it comes from the <em>course materials</em> (i.e., the course textbook, companion booksite, programming assignment specifications, checklists, lecture slides, lecture videos, and precepts). If you do so, you must cite any code that you copy or adapt (with the exception of code that is included with the assignment). </p>

		<p><strong>Plagiarism detection.</strong> We use sophisticated software tools to detect plagiarism. For example, we compare each submission (including interim submissions) against a code database, which includes all submissions from this offering and previous offerings of the course. While we take no pleasure in bringing cases to the Committee on Discipline; it is our duty to keep the playing field level for the overwhelming majority of students who work very hard in this course and follow the rules. </p>

		<p><strong>Penalties.</strong> We refer alleged academic violations (including plagiarism and abetting plagiarism) to the <a href="https://rrr.princeton.edu/students#comp252">Committee on Discipline</a>. If found responsible, the typical penalty is an F as a course grade plus whatever penalty that the CoD imposes. (The typical CoD penalty for plagiarism is suspension from the University for one year.) Violators of course policies that are not adjudicated by the CoD will receive penalties based on the severity of the violation, ranging from a warning (for violations that are both unintentional and innocuous) to an F in the course (for violations that are both intentional and serious).</p>
